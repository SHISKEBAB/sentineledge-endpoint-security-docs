# About Me

## Who I Am

I am a technical writer with a growing specialization in **cybersecurity and endpoint security documentation**.  
My work focuses on translating complex security concepts into **clear, accurate, and actionable documentation** for administrators, IT teams, and security stakeholders.

I approach documentation as a **product discipline**, not an afterthought—grounded in structure, consistency, and real-world usage.

## What This Repository Represents

This repository showcases my end-to-end approach to **security product documentation** using a fictional but realistic endpoint protection platform called **SentinelEdge**.

SentinelEdge is not a commercial product. It is a **documentation-first simulation** designed to demonstrate how I:
- Understand cybersecurity concepts
- Structure security documentation
- Apply docs-as-code practices
- Manage documentation work using GitHub Projects
- Maintain consistency across articles, product docs, and release notes

All content here is intentionally designed to reflect **real-world security documentation workflows**.

---

## Why I Built SentinelEdge

Modern security products are powerful—but often difficult to understand without good documentation.

I built SentinelEdge to practice and demonstrate:
- Writing clear endpoint security documentation
- Explaining malware, exploits, and ransomware without unnecessary jargon
- Aligning documentation with the product lifecycle
- Applying the Microsoft Style Guide to security content
- Using GitHub as a documentation management platform

This repository reflects my belief that **strong documentation improves security outcomes**.

## How This Repository Is Organized
|-- README.md → SentinelEdge product overview

|--about-me.md → Author intent and context (this file)

|-- /articles → Security-focused technical articles

|-- /docs → Product documentation (concepts, tasks, references)

|-- /release-notes → Structured security release notes

|-- GitHub Projects → 20-day execution and documentation plan

Each section is intentionally linked to support a **cohesive documentation ecosystem**.

## The Writing & Documentation Process

I manage this repository using:
- **GitHub Projects** for planning and execution
- **Markdown** for consistency and portability
- **Docs-as-code principles** for versioning and traceability
- **Incremental delivery** (daily writing and iteration)

The project board documents:
- Planning decisions
- Daily execution
- Writing progress
- Iterative improvements

This mirrors how documentation work is handled in professional product teams.

## What You’ll Find Here

- Clear explanations of endpoint security concepts
- Writer-friendly breakdowns of antivirus, EDR, XDR, exploits, and ransomware
- Security documentation written for real users—not just engineers
- Release notes that explain *why* changes matter
- A visible, repeatable documentation workflow

---

## Where to Start

If you’re new to this repository, I recommend starting with:
1. **README.md** – for the SentinelEdge product overview  
2. **Articles folder** – to see how I explain security concepts  
3. **GitHub Projects board** – to understand my execution process

## My Documentation Philosophy

Good security documentation should:
- Reduce ambiguity
- Support faster incident response
- Prevent misconfiguration
- Respect the reader’s time
- Balance technical accuracy with clarity

This repository is a living demonstration of that philosophy.

---

## Final Note

This work reflects my commitment to growing as a **security-focused technical writer**.  
I continuously refine both my **domain knowledge** and **documentation craft**, treating learning and execution as ongoing processes.

Thank you for taking the time to explore this repository.
